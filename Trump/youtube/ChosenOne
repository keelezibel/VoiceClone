So, somebody... Excuse me. Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it. So, I'm taking it on China. I'm taking on China on trade. And you know what? We're winning. Because we're the piggy bank. We're the one that all these countries, including the European union, wants to Rob and takes advantage. European union, $200-billion. China, more than $500-billion. Sorry. I was put here by people to do a great job and that's what I'm doing. And nobody's done a job like I've done. Now, would China rather wait for a little more than a year and try and get sleepy Joe Biden to negotiate with instead of President Trump? Maybe, but I don't think so. You know why? They're losing too many jobs too fast. They had the worst year in 27 years, but I think it was actually 52 or 54 years. It was the worst year they've had in a half a century, and that's because of me. And I'm not proud of that. But you know what? They want to negotiate, sleepy Joe doesn't have a clue. Sleepy Joe said, "Oh, China's wonderful." Well, China is wonderful for China, but I'm wonderful for the USA.
